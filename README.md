This is the official GitHub Repository of OWASP Security Bridge.

“Security Bridge” aims to build bridges in our community to go beyond the technical aspects of application security and start talking and learning about the daily challenges we face that impact our success and wellbeing.

An overview can be found on the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-security-bridge/">OWASP Project Page</a>.

- Check “Online community space”: by using <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/security-bridge/discussions"><img src="Images/GitHub_logo.png" width="14px"> GitHub Discussions</a>, industry professionals have a forum to share their thoughts and experiences across 3 main areas around wellbeing and resilience.

- “Resource Hub”: provides markdown files in the Github repo, offering training resources for employees to easily access and share with their peers and teams. The focus is to raise awareness and equip professionals in the Application Security industry (and beyond) with knowledge, tools and guidance to help prevent burnout and build greater resilience; essential to overall mental health & wellbeing. The following TTPs are available:

  - [Lightening the Mental Load: Clearing Space for Opportunities](TTP/TTP-001.md)
  - [The Power of Breathwork for Stress Management](TTP/TTP-002.md)

TTPs are being used in this project in a similar fashion as in MITRE ATT&CK to help cyber security professionals relate to have an execution path that they can apply to their daily lives.


## Introduction: Uncovering Stress 

### Success & Stress – Balancing the Scales of Achievement

In today's fast-paced world, success is often measured by one's ability to achieve goals, climb the corporate ladder, and accumulate accolades. It's a pursuit that drives many of us, but what can often lurk beneath the surface of success is chronic stress and, at times, unhappiness.

In our experience working in the field of people development, we've observed that even outwardly successful leaders can find themselves overwhelmed by the demands of life and their never-ending to-do lists. Unfortunately, in their pursuit of success, they burn out their greatest assets: themselves. This can also have a ripple effect on those around them, including employees who may be inadvertently driven into the ground – creating a culture of stress. 

### The Definition of Success: Is It Synonymous with Happiness?

As the topic of stress and burnout gains prominence in the workplace, more people are questioning the traditional definition of success. It raises a fundamental question: isn’t the essence of hard work, hustling, and accomplishments to ultimately find happiness? Success should ideally lead to a sense of fulfillment, shouldn't it?

Success, however, is a dynamic concept that evolves as we progress through different stages of life. What it means to us today might be entirely different in five years. Nevertheless, the innate drive to strive exists within us. While this is no doubt a positive force, we want to shed light on another crucial aspect: the importance of being mindful and intentional about HOW we pursue our goals.

### The Sneaky Build-Up and High Cost of Stress and Burnout

While ambition and hard work are commendable traits, achieving success through a constant rush, excessive effort, and neglecting self-care can come at a high cost: stress and burnout. 

Stress, to a certain extent, can be a motivator, propelling us to take action and fueling us. Many of us even find that we're most productive when we're under pressure. However, ongoing, unmanaged stress is the nemesis of success. Research indicates that it can become a major obstacle, hindering our ability to perform at our fullest potential.

One of the key issues with stress is that most of us aren't attuned to its gradual build-up until we reach a breaking point. Operating under constant stress and pressure has become the norm, leaving us without a benchmark to recognise when we've gone beyond our optimum or crossed the line.


### Increasing Awareness and Arming Ourselves with Tools and Techniques for Wellbeing & Success

To effectively manage stress and prevent burnout, adopting a proactive and preemptive approach is crucial. We must equip ourselves with the ability to better navigate stress, including deliberately assessing the stressors accumulating within us; regardless of their perceived size or impact at the moment. This requires a shift from reactive stress management to proactive stress awareness.

This GitHub Respository provides professionals with knowledge, tools and tactics to navigate the high-pressure landscape of the Cybersecurity Industry.

Remember, for long-lasting success, it's crucial that achievement should not come at the cost of our wellbeing. Chronic stress and burnout can undermine even the most impressive accomplishments. By adopting a proactive approach to stress management, we can strike a balance between our ambitions and our inner peace. Success and wellbeing can indeed coexist.
