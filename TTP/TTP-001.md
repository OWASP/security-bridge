## Lightening the Mental Load: Clearing Space for Opportunities

Our mental load comprises a multitude of responsibilities, from work-related tasks and household chores to personal goals and obligations. This load can overwhelm our mental capacity, leaving us with limited bandwidth for creativity, relaxation, and pursuing our aspirations.

### Clearing Mental Space

To reduce stress, achieve our goals and experience fulfilment, it's essential to clear mental space. Here are some simple steps to start this process:

1. **Reflect**: Take a few moments to jot down what's on your mental load this week or month. Include responsibilities, tasks, and thoughts that occupy your mind.

2. **Prioritise and Focus**: When everything in our mental load seems urgent or important, it can be challenging to focus on what truly matters. 

Here are 3 valuable techniques to help you prioritise and gain clarity:

1. **The 2-Minute Rule**:
  - **Technique**: If a task can be completed in two minutes or less, do it immediately. Otherwise, add it to your to-do list.
  - **Procedure**: This rule helps you swiftly address small tasks, preventing them from accumulating and consuming mental space. For larger tasks, acknowledge them but save them for later.
2. **Tips for Sharing the Load at Work**:
  - **Set expectations**
    - I have multiple deadlines this week, can we work together to prioritise?
  - **Make it normal to ask:**
    - Can I get back to you tomorrow?
    - What does ASAP mean - tomorrow, next week?
  - **Challenge yourself and ask yourself:**
    - Whatâ€™s stopping you from speaking up?
    - Is the fear real or perceived?
3. **The Impact-Effort Matrix**:
  - **Technique**: Create a graph with Impact on one axis and Effort on the other. Categorise tasks as low impact/low effort, low impact/high effort, high impact/low effort, or high impact/high effort.
  - **Procedure**: Focus on tasks with high impact and low effort, as they can lead to significant results without overwhelming you. Deprioritise or delegate tasks that require high effort and yield low impact.
