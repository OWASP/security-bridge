# Communication skills for Wellbeing 

Wellbeing is a learned skill, and like anything learned, it needs practice and reinforcement. Much like acquiring a new language or mastering a musical instrument, honing these skills requires dedication and repetition.

What skills are in your #WorkplaceWellbeing toolkit and what skills can you sharpen?

Try â€˜prioritisingâ€™ prioritisation this week. This isnâ€™t just about checking off tasks, itâ€™s about strategic decision-making and directing our limited resources to what truly matters.

Here are some basic steps to get started:

- ðŸ¥… GOALS:  Start by understanding your broader goals and values. Identify behaviours and activities that propels you towards these aspirations or shows that youâ€™re embodying your values. Prioritise these!

- ðŸŽ¯ IMPACT: Evaluate the effort required (input) versus the impact generated (output) of tasks or projects. Focus on tasks with high impact and low effort. Deprioritise or delegate those with low impact and high effort. Plot out your analysis on a graph to visualise (or for fun!).

- ðŸš§ PRACTICE BOUNDARIES! A necessary (but underutilised) wellbeing skill. Say "no" deliberately, allocate personal time, and steadfastly stick to your commitments. Boundaries help us commit to high-priority items and gracefully release the rest.

When we sharpen these skills collectively, they empower us to manage stress more effectively, create space for new opportunities, and ultimately enhance our overall well-being and long-term success.
